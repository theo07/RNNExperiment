RNN experiment with pre-processing on TensorFlow

Very good paper about this:
 [SESSION-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS WITH
RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06939.pdf)

NOTE : model inspired by these tutorials
https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/tree/master/notebooks
But the tutorials found are generic and most tutorials follow same pattern
